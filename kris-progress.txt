I noticed that by using -p 5000:5000 flask would be available on localhost
In the front end I changed the endpoint's host to match, and it worked
these are the commands I used in that position.

docker run -dit --rm --network thingnet --name frontend -p 3000:3000 react
docker run -dit --rm --network thingnet --name db --network-alias db mongo
docker run -dit --rm --network thingnet --name backend -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env flask

I am not 100% satisfied with this, as it assumes the server is running on the 
machine viewing the webpage.
